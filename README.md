Craft items using letters! Spells is a new way to play Minecraft. It uses a fun way to craft items using words. This is both a puzzle adventure and a survival world. Restart time using your wits as you explore the halls in the adventure. For survival, craft items from letters that naturally spawn through the world. TNT? No problem. Need cake? Spell it... and it is yours!
